# This repository is not yet ready for forking.
# DriveFlare 
A Google Drive file index made from scratch enhances focus on speed and stability. Alternative of gdindex, made from scratch. The project is currently under development and will be published soon.

* I initiated this project repository due to issues with other GDIndex, Bhadoo Index, and GoIndex implementations, which have recently failed to download files or experienced reduced speed.

I will release the latest tag or release in a few days. Please wait before forking as the full version of the project will be available soon. It's not ready for publication yet.
